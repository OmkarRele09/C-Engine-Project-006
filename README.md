# 🚗 C-Engine-006 — Speeding Fine Checker ⚠️💨

Part of my **C-Engine Series**, where I merge mechanical engineering concepts with C programming to build real-world inspired mini tools.

## 🔥 About
This program checks the speed entered by the user and displays whether the driver is overspeeding or driving safely.  
Inspired by real car safety systems and digital dashboards.

## 📐 Logic Used
- If speed > 100 → Driver is overspeeding  
- Else → Safe driving  

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- `scanf()` for user input  
- Variables (`int`)  
- Basic if–else condition  
- Clean automotive-style output  

## 🧩 Example  
**Input:**  
Speed: `120 km/h`

**Output:**  
`Fine: You are overspeeding`
